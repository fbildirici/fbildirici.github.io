    I'm currently pursuing a <strong>PhD in Artificial Intelligence</strong> at <a href="https://www.ankara.edu.tr/programlar/4/928/4432-2070/" target="_blank">Ankara University</a>, after earning an MSc in <strong>Management Information Systems</strong> and in <strong>Cognitive Science</strong>—because why settle for just one field when you can explore multiple?
  </p>
  <p>
    I work as <strong>Senior Subject Matter Expert</strong> at <a href="https://www.aselsan.com.tr/" target="_blank"><strong>ASELSAN</strong></a>, where I lead transformative projects and initiatives. I also embrace this role in various transformation projects and provide consultancy to startups, collaborating with innovative tech companies specializing in AI and digital transformation.
  </p>
  <p>
    My core focus is on <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>software development</strong>, with a keen interest in <strong>Explainable AI</strong>, <strong>AI Integrations into Business</strong>, and <strong>Innovations in AI</strong>. I'm dedicated to building <strong>explainable</strong> and <strong>responsible AI systems</strong> that prioritize <strong>transparency</strong> and <strong>ethical integration</strong> into society. Ultimately, I believe in the power of AI to drive positive change—and I'm here to help make that happen.
