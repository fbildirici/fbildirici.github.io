 The need for explanations that are both technically correct and cognitively meaningful to a wide range of users has been highlighted by the rapid spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in high-stakes fields like healthcare, finance, and law.  The current Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as saliency maps, feature importance scores, and counterfactuals, are still primarily model-centered and frequently fall short in bridging the gap between technical transparency and human comprehension.
